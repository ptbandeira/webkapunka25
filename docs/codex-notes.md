# Codex Session Notes

## 2025-09-18
- Sprint goal: wire Decap-provided customer reviews through build outputs and surface them on Home + PDP behind `features.reviews`.
- Key deliverables: Decap collection config, `scripts/build-reviews.ts` (writes default + per-locale JSON), `components/ReviewsGrid`, integration points on Home and PDP, locale override behaviour.
- Current state: partial scaffolding exists (`client/scripts/build-reviews.ts`, placeholder `components/reviews/ReviewsGrid.tsx`, Decap collection entry) but requires validation against spec and integration.
- Progress: reviews collection refined, build pipeline emits default/locale JSON with overrides, `ReviewsGrid` implemented and wired on Home + PDP (feature-flagged).
- Progress (cont.): contact + clinics forms now submit to hardened API routes with Zod validation, honeypot/timing checks, rate limiting, and optional captcha verification; client forms consume structured errors inline.
- Progress (cont.): sitemap generation now creates locale-specific page/product/learn sitemaps plus RSS feeds at `/learn/rss.xml` and `/<locale>/learn/rss.xml`, using content timestamps or `.rev` as fallbacks.
- Progress (cont.): centralised legacy redirect mapping (`config/redirects.json`) reflected in `netlify.toml`; custom /404 and /500 views reuse the primary layout styling.
- Progress (cont.): analytics now respect a consent banner (feature-flagged, stored in localStorage, DNT-aware) and block tracking until accepted.
- Outstanding: revisit OG image route build error (`app/api/og/route.ts`) if it should compile cleanly; wire optional Turnstile/Recaptcha widgets on the client when product decides (server is ready).
